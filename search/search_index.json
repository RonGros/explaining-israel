I have watched history being rewritten before my eyes, with many people\u2014including well-educated individuals\u2014falling for these distortions. In response, I began actively addressing these false narratives, frequently encountering new claims that required further research into the history of Israel and the conflict.  Over time, I noticed that most of these claims started to repeat themselves (though there are occasional surprises). I realized I had reached a level of understanding that could benefit others who are as passionate about this topic as I am. That\u2019s why I decided to create a knowledge base, allowing selected contributors to help expand it.

The goal is to create a false equivalence between Hamas\u2014a murderous terror organization\u2014and Israel, a democratic country, and to diminish the shock of Hamas\u2019s actions, especially those committed on October 7th. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Comparing Israeli hostages to Palestinian prisoners (who usually committed violent crimes)</li> <li>Accusing Israeli soldiers of raping Palestinian women</li> <li>Accusing Israeli soldiers of targeting civilians</li> <li>Accusing Israelis of dehumanizing Palestinians and teaching their children to hate</li> <li>And so on</li> </ul> <p>My approach is to provide real examples of how the other side engages in exactly these behaviors (which are easy to find\u2014I will add resources for easier access) and to show that these accusations are, in fact, projections of what Hamas and the PA actually do.</p>"},{"location":"General/Propaganda-Tactics/#trash-talking","title":"Trash-Talking","text":"<p>Another prevalent tactic is the deliberate and repeated dissemination of false accusations, operating on the principle that if a lie is told often enough, people will eventually accept it as truth.

Instead, they'll launch into a litany of emotionally charged accusations, such as calling you a \"genocider, baby-killer, ethno-cleansing, European white colonizer, apartheid terror state,\" among other inflammatory terms. The core objective behind this constant repetition is to sway the opinions of other readers.</p> <p>My tactic is to call them out exactly - saying that they can repeat these lies, but it will not make them real, and then to address at least some of these accusations show how false they are We will address some of these accusations in specific pages</p>"},{"location":"General/Propaganda-Tactics/#from-specific-to-generic","title":"From specific to generic","text":"<p>This tactic involves presenting a claim supported by examples, but crucially, these examples are anecdotal or non-representative of the norm, sometimes even undermining the original claim upon closer inspection. It exploits the fact that most readers lack the in-depth knowledge to differentiate between actual reality and isolated incidents.</p> <p>Consider these common examples:</p> <p>A video of a Jewish mother asking her child what he wants to be when he grows up, and he replies, \"I want to kill Arabs.\"</p> <p>Referencing the case of Elor Azaria, who killed a Palestinian (terrorist) after he was already incapacitated on the ground.</p> <p>Mentioning the Deir Yassin massacre.</p> <p>These examples are frequently used to portray Israelis as villains, yet they are either isolated incidents or, upon examination, demonstrate the opposite:</p> <p>The first video is an anecdote, not indicative of widespread sentiment.</p> <p>Elor Azaria was prosecuted and imprisoned for his actions, which directly refutes the idea that such behavior is condoned or supported.</p> <p>Deir Yassin is a complex historical event that warrants detailed discussion.

Its structure typically follows this pattern: \"Given the implicit false premise A, I assert that false claim B.\"</p> <p>The design of this structure aims to maneuver the audience into attempting to refute \"claim B.\" In doing so, they inadvertently concede the validity of \"premise A,\" even if it is fundamentally untrue. This effectively forces you to \"play on the opponent's terms,\" often leading the discussion to grounds where your position is inherently disadvantaged. The true subtlety of these claims lies in their often non-obvious nature, making them particularly tricky to identify.</p> <p>Consider the following example, based on a graph depicting political violence events between the IDF and Hezbollah (source: ACLED, \"Situation update: Israel-Hezbollah conflict\"): Situation update: Israel-Hezbollah conflict): </p> <p>By combining the implicit (and often false) premise that Israel is invading Lebanon with the visual representation suggesting the IDF provokes more violence, this graph can lead readers to believe that the IDF is solely the aggressor, while Hezbollah is not. Notice how this perceived aggression appears consistent from \"day one\" of the conflict according to the visual.</p> <p>While I won't delve into the accuracy or potential bias of ACLED's data here, as they are generally considered a credible source, the deceptive nature of this presentation lies elsewhere. By presenting this graph, the discussion is immediately drawn towards the raw numbers. Implicitly, however, you are pressured to accept an equivalence between Hezbollah and the IDF. This is problematic, as Hezbollah has been indiscriminately firing rockets at northern Israel, whereas Israel's actions primarily target Hezbollah centers in an effort to prevent these attacks.</p> <p>This serves as just one example of how such multi-layered claims can subtly drag you into uncomfortable or disadvantageous argumentative territories, sometimes without you even realizing you've been manipulated.</p>"},{"location":"General/Propaganda-Tactics/#pro-palestine","title":"Pro-Palestine","text":"<p>Here's a critical, though perhaps controversial, observation: The \"Pro-Palestine\" label is often used to frame any opposition as being \"Against Palestine.\" This immediately puts you at a disadvantage, as being \"for\" something is inherently seen more positively than being \"against\" it.

While farmers may have traditionally or religiously viewed themselves as landowners, formal land ownership records were not systematically maintained. The 19th century brought significant reforms, including the initiation of land registration and the introduction of a new land code in 1858.

In the early 1800s, there were only around 250,000 Muslims in the country. While this was still much more than the number of Jews, you also need to consider that Jews were expelled by the Ottoman Empire and had to live as second-class citizens (paying the Jizya tax, along with other taxes). The Ottoman Empire promoted migration into less populated areas (such as Israel), increasing the Muslim population during the 16th century.</p> <p>In 1831, Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt took control of the land of Israel and controlled it until 1839. During that time, he sent many (numbers are unknown but estimated to be more than 30,000 people) to live there, increasing the number of Muslims in the area.</p> <p>During the British Mandate, many more Muslims immigrated to Palestine for economic reasons.
