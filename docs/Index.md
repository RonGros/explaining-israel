# Welcome	

Welcome to the ***Explaining Israel*** wiki pages!
This set of documents is meant for either pepole who want to actively participate in defending the State of Israel and the Jewish people from the anti-Israeli and antisemitic narratives flooding the social media since the October 7th massacre (and probably much earlier, but not out in the open)
And also for those who are not as informed about the Israeli-Arab conflict, and are seeking some more information to decide where they stand, and who they should believe

# How and why…
Since October 2023, I started getting exposed to social network narratives that presented “alternative truths” about Israel and the conflict. I watched how history has been re-written in front of my eyes, with many people, including well-educated people, falling for it.
I have been actively trying to address these false narratives, every time bumping into a new claim that I had to debunk by doing more and more research and reading about details of the history of Israel and the conflict. 
After some time I felt like most of the claims I was seeing started repeating themselves (although there are new suprises from time to time), and decided that I reached a certain degree of knowledge where it would be good if I shared it with others who are as pationate as I am about the topic, and decided the best way of doing it is to create database of knowledge that I can allow selected people to contribute to.
I will try, as much as I can, to add sources and links to things that can help people understand and expalin things better, hoepfully - we can make this world a bit better!
