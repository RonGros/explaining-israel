# Education

## Intro
Education is a key for peace. If you really want to have peace between two people you need both of them to want it, and to understand that the best path forward is if both sides are happy

Therefore education, similar to media, is also a very good indicator for the real intentions of the leadership, because it shapes the minds of young kids, and their future views when they become adults

I would argue that it takes around 20 years to "re-educate" a certain group to stop hating another group, and that makes it even more important, because it takes a lot of preparation, and a lot of time to get two people have peace


## Relenvance to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
One of the repeating allegations against Israel is that "*Israelis teach their children to hate*" or "*Israelis teach their children to dehumanize the Palestinians*" 

We will cover this claim here

## Let's dive in
### Tactics being used in this claim
!!! info "The Propaganda Tactics Page" 
    If you haven't read it before, I invite you to read the propaganda tactics page

We can recognize two main tactics used when talking to education:
1. **Counter-blaming** - It is clear that the Palestinians (both Hamas and the more moderate PA) are indoctrinating children to hate Israelis
2. **From specific to generic** - people give examples here that do not represent the generalization

Do note that Israel is not perfect. and you can find bad examples. but that does not make it worsed than any other democratic country (you can find Nazis in Germany, and KKK in the US, but you do not claim they are villians because it is not systematic)

### The evidence

#### The Israeli side
There is not much evidence from the anti-Israeli side to this claim. what I did see being used are:
* Videos showing specific people teaching their children to hate
* A blog post (by an Israeli woman) that says that Israel is wiping out the Arab identity in its education system

When you do try to ask people to show an example of official education books that dehumanize the Palestinians there is no answer because there are no such books.
On the other hand you can find books that talk about living together, also when you look at the official schoolbooks, you will find both Arabic and Hebrew books. here is an example of the book "Living together" where you can see on the front page Jews and Arabs together:

#### The Palestinian side
There is overwhelming evidence of anti-Jewish and anti Israeli education, and education that promotes "Mertyrhood" and violence against Israelis in the Palestinian education system, both by Hamas and by the Palestinian Authority that is considered much more moderate
