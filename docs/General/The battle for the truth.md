# The Battle for Truth
The immediate and widespread nature of the anti-Israeli campaign following October 7th strongly suggested a pre-existing, long-term preparation. This became even more apparent when elite U.S. Ivy League universities began echoing pro-Hamas sentiments and parroting anti-Israeli propaganda, indicating that this indoctrination had begun much earlier.

During my research, I encountered a particularly insightful piece by Gary Wexler, titled [The Inside Story of How Palestinians Took Over the World](https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/columnist/365220/the-inside-story-of-how-palestinians-took-over-the-world/)

The conflict we are currently engaged in is a multi-front battle. This includes:

* **Infiltrating Academic Institutions**: Injecting anti-Israeli agendas into universities, influencing future generations.

* **Sophisticated Social Media Operations**: Executing highly sophisticated campaigns utilizing automation, bots, and meticulously prepared fake accounts.

* **Co-opting Credible Organizations**: Creating or hijacking existing internationally credible human rights organizations and similar bodies to lend legitimacy to their narrative.

* **Leveraging Diaspora Support**: Gaining support from a segment of Muslim immigrants who, without critical questioning, automatically side with fellow Muslims.

* **Rewriting Digital History**: Systematically altering Wikipedia pages to align with their narrative (as detailed in "[How Wikipediaâ€™s Pro-Hamas Editors Hijacked the Israel-Palestine Narrative](https://www.piratewires.com/p/how-wikipedia-s-pro-hamas-editors-hijacked-the-israel-palestine-narrative)" by Pirate Wires).

Given that the objective facts often do not align with the anti-Israeli campaign's claims, it is logical that they would resort to rewriting history. This is achieved through several key methods:

1. Manufacturing New Content: Creating new material specifically designed for easy discoverability and widespread sharing across the internet.

2. Manipulating Wikipedia: Rewriting existing Wikipedia entries, recognizing its status as a primary source of information and "truth" for many today.

3. Exploiting Media Channels: Utilizing influential media outlets, such as Al-Jazeera and, regrettably, even the BBC, to disseminate their propaganda.

4. Crafting Persuasive Social Media Content: Developing content for platforms like TikTok and Instagram, operating on the assumption that users are unlikely to question what they see, especially if presented in a highly persuasive manner.
