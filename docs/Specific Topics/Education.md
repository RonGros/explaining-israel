# Education

## Introduction

Education is fundamental to achieving peace. Genuine peace between two groups necessitates mutual desire for it and a shared understanding that the optimal path forward involves the well-being and satisfaction of both sides.

Consequently, education, much like media, serves as a crucial indicator of a leadership's true intentions, as it profoundly shapes the minds of young children and their future perspectives as adults.

I would contend that it takes approximately 20 years to "re-educate" a group to overcome ingrained hatred towards another. This makes the role of education even more critical, as fostering peace requires extensive preparation and a significant investment of time to bridge divides between peoples.

## Relevance to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

A recurring accusation leveled against Israel is that "Israelis teach their children to hate" or "Israelis teach their children to dehumanize Palestinians."

This section will address and examine these claims.

## Let's Dive In

### Tactics Used in This Claim

If you haven't read it before, I invite you to read the propaganda tactics page.

When discussing education in this context, two primary propaganda tactics are frequently employed:

1.  **Counter-blaming:** This tactic is used to deflect from the clear evidence that Palestinian authorities (both Hamas and the more moderate Palestinian Authority) are indoctrinating children with hatred towards Israelis.
2.  **From Specific to Generic:** Here, examples are presented that, while perhaps true in isolation, do not represent the general reality and are used to create a misleading generalization.

It is important to acknowledge that Israel is not without flaws, and isolated negative examples can be found. However, this does not make Israel worse than any other democratic country. Just as one can still find Nazis in Germany or KKK members in the U.S. without claiming these nations are inherently villainous, isolated incidents in Israel do not indicate a systemic issue.

### The Evidence

#### The Israeli Side

There is limited substantive evidence from the anti-Israeli side to support the claim of systematic hatred in Israeli education. The arguments typically presented include:

  * Videos purporting to show specific individuals teaching their children to hate.
  * A blog post (written by an Israeli woman) alleging that Israel's education system is eradicating Arab identity.

When challenged to provide examples of official Israeli textbooks that dehumanize Palestinians, no such evidence is forthcoming, as these books do not exist. Conversely, official Israeli schoolbooks, available in both Arabic and Hebrew, promote coexistence. An example is the book "Living Together," which prominently features Jews and Arabs together on its cover:

#### The Palestinian Side

In stark contrast, there is overwhelming evidence of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli education within the Palestinian system, promoting "martyrdom" and violence against Israelis. This is evident in educational materials from both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, despite the latter being considered more moderate.
