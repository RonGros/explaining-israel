# The Palestinians welcomed the Jews

Many people claim that

!!! quote "Claim"
		The Palestinians welcomed the Jews and helped saving them from the Nazis,  
        and in return the Jews stole their land and kicked them out of their homes

When in fact this couldn’t be further from the truth.

As for the claim that Jews stole lands, this is discussed on another page, this page will explore the claim of the welcoming of Jews by Palestinians and the relation between Palestinians and the Nazis

## Welcoming Jews
### Jewish Migration
The Arabs were very alarmed by the Jewish immigration, and this caused frustration and an uprise within the Arab society in Palestine  
In fact the big [Arab Revolt in 1936](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine) occurred because the Palestinian leaders considered the British immigration policy to be too easy for the Jews

As a retulst of the Arab ressistance to the Jewish immigration, the British Government issued the “[1939 White Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939)” which further restricted Jewish immigration.
One can argue that this policy led to more Jews murdered on European soil because they could not escape to Israel
In fact the Immigration ship [Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Exodus), that, in 1947, took thousands of Holocaust survivors from Europe to Israel was rejected by the British Government sending them back to refugee camps Europe

### Attacks on Jewish communities
In addition to fighting immigration, the Arabs constantly attacked Jewish communities. 
The Jews had to found a special defense organiztion called “[Hashomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashomer)” to protect their communities

Known attacks were:
* The [1920 attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tel_Hai) on Tel Hai
* The [1929 Hebron Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre)
* The 1929 Sefad massacre

But there were [many](https://www.camera.org/article/anti-jewish-violence-in-pre-state-palestine-1929-massacres/) more attacks, most are not well documented as they were part of the day-to-day in Israel 

## The ties of the Palestinian ledership to the Nazis 
The grand Mufti of Jerusalem, [Amin Al Husseini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amin_al-Husseini), who was a prominent leader of the Palestinians, actually had ties with the Nazi party, and helped the Nazis against Britian. 

Here is a video of [Amin Al Husseini meeting Hitler](https://youtu.be/Da-vqzTk1vs?si=730Htv7SsP39PfZa&t=1972)

Al Husseini supported the extermination of Jews in Europe and, according to some statements, although never proven, had a plan to create extermination camps also in the middle east


## Conclusion
The claim that Arabs welcomed Jews with open hands, and that they helped them escape the Nazis is unfounded, and actually could not be more far from the truth
