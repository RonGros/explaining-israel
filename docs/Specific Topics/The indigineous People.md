# The Indigineous People
## Intro
One of the strongest narratives that are being used is that the Israelis are "European White colonizers" and that they stole the land from the Palestinians who were indigineous to this land

While I will cover the first part - The European white colonizers further in another page, this page will try to handle the topic of immigrants vs indigineous and ownership over the land

## The question of who is indigineous to the land

To answer this question we would like to cover the following

1. What is the connection of the Jews and the Arabs to the land in ancient history
2. What is the connection of the Jews and the Arabs to the land in modern history

!!! warning "Sensitive topics"
	There is no one good answer to the question “this is when we start taking history into consideration” 
    There is also and no good answer to what is “too ancient” to be meaningful - meaing - if Jews lives here 3,000 years ago, but since then other families lived here for another 1,000 years. who owns the land? Hard to say…  
    Hence this topic may be disputable. I will try bringing enough evidence to make it more prominent

### The state of the population during the Ottoman empire

Another important point is that when looking at the population you need to look further back. how much? it’s hard to say

While there were more than a million muslins in Israel in 1947, that was not always the case. In fact in the early 1800s tere were only around 250,000 Muslims in the country. 
While this was still much more than the number of Jews, you also need to take into consideration the fact that the Jews were expelled also by the Ottomoan empire, and had to live as second-class citizens (paying the [Jyiza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya) tax, along with other taxes), and that the Ottoman empire [promoted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_migrations_to_Ottoman_Palestine#:~:text=Muslim%20migrations%20to%20Palestine%20began,19th%20and%20early%2020th%20centuries.) migration into less populated areas (such as Israel) and by that increased the Muslim population during the 16th century 

In 1831, Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt [took control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Ottoman_War_(1831%E2%80%931833)) over the land of Israel, and controlled it until 1839. during that time he sent many (numbers are unknown, but estimated as more than 30,000 people) to live there, increasing the number of Muslims in the area.

During the British Mandate many more Muslims immigrated to Palestine for economical reasons, this explains how the Muslim population [grew from around 250K to 1M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region)) (4 times) in less than 150 years.

So while it is true that Jewish immigration was substantial, so was the muslim immigration



### Conclusion 
Overall although the number of Jews was really small, the number of muslims, compared to the size of the land was also very small, and in fact most of them were also migrates from Egypt, or different parts of the Ottoman empire and not indigineous to the land

Do Muslim immigrants have more rights than Jewish Immigrants? I would say - No.
