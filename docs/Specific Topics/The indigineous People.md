# The Indigineous People
## Intro
One of the strongest narratives that are being used is that the Israelis are "European White colonizers" and that they stole the land from the Palestinians who were indigineous to this land

While I will cover the first part - The European white colonizers further in another page, this page will try to handle the topic of immigrants vs indigineous and ownership over the land

## The question of who is indigineous to the land

To answer this question we would like to cover the following

1. What is the connection of the Jews and the Arabs to the land in ancient history
2. What is the connection of the Jews and the Arabs to the land in modern history

!!! warning "Sensitive topics"
	There is no one good answer to the question “this is when we start taking history into consideration” 
    There is also and no good answer to what is “too ancient” to be meaningful - meaing - if Jews lives here 3,000 years ago, but since then other families lived here for another 1,000 years. who owns the land? Hard to say…  
    Hence this topic may be disputable. I will try bringing enough evidence to make it more prominent

### The state of the population during the Ottoman empire

Another important point is that when looking at the population you need to look further back. how much? it’s hard to say

While there were more than a million muslins in Israel in 1947, that was not always the case. In fact in the early 1800s tere were only around 250,000 Muslims in the country. 
While this was still much more than the number of Jews, you also need to take into consideration the fact that the Jews were expelled also by the Ottomoan empire, and had to live as second-class citizens (paying the [Jyiza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya) tax, along with other taxes), and that the Ottoman empire [promoted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_migrations_to_Ottoman_Palestine#:~:text=Muslim%20migrations%20to%20Palestine%20began,19th%20and%20early%2020th%20centuries.) migration into less populated areas (such as Israel) and by that increased the Muslim population during the 16th century 

In 1831, Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt [took control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Ottoman_War_(1831%E2%80%931833)) over the land of Israel, and controlled it until 1839. during that time he sent many (numbers are unknown, but estimated as more than 30,000 people) to live there, increasing the number of Muslims in the area.

During the British Mandate many more Muslims immigrated to Palestine for economical reasons, this explains how the Muslim population [grew from around 250K to 1M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region)) (4 times) in less than 150 years.

So while it is true that Jewish immigration was substantial, so was the muslim immigration

#### Traveller books from ancient times

While there was no early Ottoman census early enough to understand how many Jews were there prior to the 19th century, there were [quite a few](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelogues_of_Palestine) Europeans (mostly Christian who wanted to visit the holy land) who travelled to Israel in the last 2,000 years and wrote about it
Although this cannot be used as solid evidence as is subjective, it does give another perspective of the state of the land in those days 
A good example is Adriani Relandi book of 1699 - He was A Christian that wrote about  journies to the Land of Israel mentioning Jewish majoriy.

### Palestine
Another anecdote is the use of the name “Palestine”. While it is anecdotal, many posts claim that “Palestinians were there long before the Jews” and so that deserves a discussion

#### The Origin of the name
The origina of the name Palestine is from the Roman empire. 
After the Bar-Kohva revolt the Romans decided to punish the Jews by removing names that were associated with them, and instead using the name Syria (which is north to Israel) and Palestina, after the [Philistins](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistins)

!!! tip "Fun Fact"
    According to a recent [research](https://www.mpg.de/13670046/origins-of-biblical-philistines) the Philistines were actually Greek, making them European colonizers

During the Ottoman empire the name Palestina or Palestine was not used. The area of Israel was called south Syria

#### During the Mandate
When the Britians got to Israel they called the land “Palestine”. When writing in Hebrew they also used the acronym א”י - Eretz Israel (the land of Israel) 
The Arabs [did not use](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDDJZkJuyMT/) that name at the time.

[Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDLHwwFt3oW/) is a nice video about it.

Actually - while the Arabs considered themselves as Arabs, the name “Palestinians” was mostly used by the Jews and for Jews. 
For example - 

* The [Anglo-Palestine bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Leumi) was a Jewish bank, later renamed to Bank Leumi (“The national bank”) which exists to this day
* The [Palestinian Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Airways) (which was called in Hebrew “Land Of Israel Airways”/“נתיבי ארץ ישראל”) was a Jewish airline
* The [Palestine national football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine_national_football_team) team was a Jewish team, later turned into Maccabi, which exists until this day. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ACYGEmkGk&t=7s) is a video of a 1939 game of the team against Australia. note how the terms Palestinians and Jews are being for the same purpose

#### Modern Use
The use of “Palestinians” for the Arabs of the area of Palestine started to be common in 1964, when Yasser Arrafat started the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization)

!!! tip "Liberating Palestine"
	Many people claim that the Palestinians are only trying to have their own state in the borders of pre-1967. Sadly the current leadership instills the idea that the entire land of Israel is theirs, and that the state of Israel needs to be eliminated. When you talk about it - notice that the PLO was created in 1964, prior to the 1967 war, while the west bank was in the hands of Jordan, and Gaza in the hands of Egypt, and so - what was it trying to liberate? obviously - the answer is - the entire land of Israel
    The fact that this is still the view of many (and probably most) Palestinians today can be found in different surveys, and can be seen in videos such as [this video from UN Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVaCB7m4K0Q&pp=ygUIdW4gd2F0Y2g%3D), and [this video from “The Ask Project”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvdFFStvvi0&t=68s).  
    In this topic I love the quote by [Golda Meir](https://youtu.be/w3FGvAMvYpc?si=VsYu9F88TIhHWpEW&t=918) - “We were at the borders of 1967 in June of 67 and in May of 67, why wasn’t there peace?”

The smart move by the Arabs to call themselves Palestinians allowed them to connect themselves to the Area that was called Palestine for many years, and thus claim that they are the real indigineous people of the land.  
Their claim is that they are convereted Jews that lives here for thousands of years. For some it might be true, while most of them as we’ve seen, are immigrants. 
Some even go further and claim that they are descendants of the origianl Philistines. This is, of course, not true, but if it was - it would make them European colonizers (See above) 

### Jewish Presence in the land of Israel
There is no doubt, that even in small numbers, there was constant Jewish presence in the land of Israel since the ancient times (more than 3,000 years)
There is overwhelming Archeological findings that connect Jews to the land, and not that many findings that connect others to it.
To see some of them, I recommend looking at videos by [Josh](https://www.instagram.com/_j0sh_a_?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) and by [Travelling Israel](https://www.youtube.com/@Travelingisraelinfo)

### Conclusion 
As you can see - while there are Palestinians who are indigineous to the land, and there were more Arabs in Israel in the past centuries most of them are immigrants. The Palestinian identify is modern, and before that there was no distinction between Arabs from Israel, Jordan, Syria or Iraq. 
Moreover Archeological findings connect Jews to the land therefore I think it cannot be questioned that Jews are at least as, if not more indigineous to the land
