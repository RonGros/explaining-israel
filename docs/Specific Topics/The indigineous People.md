# The Indigineous People
## Intro
One of the strongest narratives that are being used is that the Israelis are "European White colonizers" and that they stole the land from the Palestinians who were indigineous to this land

While I will cover the first part - The European white colonizers further in another page, this page will try to handle the topic of immigrants vs indigineous and ownership over the land

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    While we would like to think that everything is straightforward, this topic is very sensitive and within it not everything is black and white. I will try to handle some of the sensitivities here, but will surely not be able to cover everything
