# Welcome	

Welcome to the ***Explaining Israel*** wiki pages!
This set of documents is intended for people who want to actively participate in defending the State of Israel and the Jewish people from the anti-Israeli and antisemitic narratives flooding social media since the October 7th massacre (and likely even earlier, though less openly).
It is also for those who are less informed about the Israeli-Arab conflict and are seeking more information to help decide where they stand and whom to believe.


# How and why…
Since October 2023, I have been exposed to social media narratives presenting “alternative truths” about Israel and the conflict. I have watched history being rewritten before my eyes, with many people—including well-educated individuals—falling for these distortions.
In response, I began actively addressing these false narratives, frequently encountering new claims that required further research into the history of Israel and the conflict. 
Over time, I noticed that most of these claims started to repeat themselves (though there are occasional surprises). I realized I had reached a level of understanding that could benefit others who are as passionate about this topic as I am. That’s why I decided to create a knowledge base, allowing selected contributors to help expand it.
I will do my best to provide sources and links to help people better understand and explain these issues—hopefully, together, we can make the world a little better!

# Sources of information
Reaching the point where I could respond to almost all of the opposing claims took considerable time. Occasionally, I encountered arguments that made me question our own narrative, but the more I read, the more confident I became that we are on the right side.
I will do my best to provide sources for as many topics as possible, and I will try to include non-Israeli sources whenever I can, as these are often seen as more credible—though this may not always be possible.

I hope you find this interesting and useful!

# Right of self determination
This site does not reject the right of self-determination for Palestinians. Even if the Palestinian identity is relatively modern, that does not mean they lack rights. This is a complex dispute that will not be explored here.
Instead, this site aims to provide context and factual evidence in response to various anti-Israeli claims.
